<h2> Theory of Urie Bronfenbrenner </h2>

<p> according to bronfenbrenner's theory. development is influenced by experiences arising from broader soial and cultural systems as well as a child's immediate sorroundings. Ecological Systems Theory, also
called “Development in Context” or “Human Ecology” theory, specifies four types of
nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the
systems. This ecological theory of Bronfenbrenner presents the sociocultural view of development
which focuses on the changing relations between individuals and the environments in
which they live. It consists of five environmental systems ranging from the individual’s
direct interactions with social agents to the broad-based inputs of culture. The five
systems in Bronfenbrenner’s ecological theory are the <b><mark><u> microsystem, mesosystem,
exosystem, macrosystem, and chronosystem.</b></mark></u> </p>

<p> <u><b>microsystem</u></b> in ecological theory is the setting in which an individual lives
(Bronfenbrenner 1979). This context includes the person’s family, peers, school,
neighbourhood, etc. is the immediate environment in which a person is operating. The
individual directly interacts with this environment and the latter has a direct impact on a
child’s biological and psychological development. The key concept is the “direct contact”
between the child and the niche </p>
<p><u><b><mark> mesosystem </u></b></mark> in ecological theory involves linkages between Microsystems.</p>
